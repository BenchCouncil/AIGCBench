# AIGCBench
Our AIGCBench aims to establish a comprehensive benchmark for video generation tasks. Our dataset includes image-text and video-text pairs, and our evaluation metrics cover four dimensions: control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video quality.

## Acknowledgments
